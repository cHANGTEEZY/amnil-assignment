# Internship Projects

This repository contains all the projects that I have completed during my internship, using JavaScript and React.js. The projects are organized in a `projects` folder, where each project is stored as a submodule.

## Projects Folder

The `projects` folder contains multiple submodules, each representing a different project I have worked on. These projects are built using JavaScript and React.js and cover a variety of topics.

### Submodules

Each project inside the `projects` folder is a Git submodule. To ensure that you have access to all the submodules and their content, follow the instructions below.

## Installation Instructions

To set up the repository and its submodules on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   Clone the main repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cHANGTEEZY/amnil-assignment.git
   ```

2. **Initialize and update the submodules**:

   After cloning the repository, navigate into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd amnil-assignment
   ```

   Run the following commands to initialize and fetch all submodules:

   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update --recursive --remote
   ```

   This will initialize all submodules and download their content. The `--recursive` flag ensures that nested submodules are also initialized and updated, while `--remote` fetches the latest changes from the remote repository.

Now you have successfully cloned the repository and all its submodules. Each project in the `projects` folder should be fully accessible and ready for use.
